    "Python is a interpreted, high-level programming language that is meant to be easily understandable and usable for a multitude of purposes. It is composed of libraries that contain useful tools for you to do quick and efficient data analysis and visualization. These libraries are like Lego blocks - you can pick and choose which ones you want to build your end product. The Scientific Python Ecosystem is composed of key libraries (i.e. NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib) that serve as a basis for most other libraries (i.e. MetPy). In this notebook, we'll briefly touch on several of these foundational libraries of the SciPy Ecosystem."
