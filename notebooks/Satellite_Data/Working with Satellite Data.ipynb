    "The first step is to find the satellite data. Normally, we would browse over to http://thredds.ucar.edu/thredds/ and find the top-level [THREDDS Data Server (TDS)](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/tds/TDS.html) catalog. From there we can drill down to find satellite data products.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we want to utilize the new GOES-16 imagery. This imagery is still considered experimental and not for operational use, so it is found on the test dataserver at http://thredds-test.unidata.ucar.edu/. For current data, you could navigate to the `Test Datasets` directory, then `GOES-16 Products` and `GOES-16`. There are subfolders for the CONUS, full disk, and mesoscale sector images. In each of theses is a folder for each [channel of the ABI](http://www.goes-r.gov/education/ABI-bands-quick-info.html). In each channel there is a folder for every day in the month-long rolling archive. As you can see, there is a massive amount of data coming down from GOES-16! For the workshop we will be using archived case study data from Irma located at [http://thredds-test.unidata.ucar.edu/thredds/catalog/casestudies/irma/goes16](http://thredds-test.unidata.ucar.edu/thredds/catalog/casestudies/irma/goes16).\n",

    "\n",
    "We can use Unidata's [Siphon](https://github.com/Unidata/siphon) package to parse the catalog from the TDS. This provides us a nice programmatic way of accessing the data. We start by importing the `TDSCatalog` class from siphon and giving it the URL to the catalog we just surfed to manually. **Note:** Instead of giving it the link to the HTML catalog, we change the extension to XML, which asks the TDS for the XML version of the catalog. This is much better to work with in code. \n",
