    "XArray expands on the capabilities on NumPy arrays, providing a lot of streamlined data manipulation. It is similar in that respect to Pandas, but whereas Pandas excels at working with tabular data, XArray is focused on N-dimensional arrays of data (i.e. grids). Its interface is based largely on the netCDF data model (variables, attributes, and dimensions), but it goes beyond the traditional netCDF interfaces to provide functionality similar to netCDF-java's Common Data Model (CDM).
