    "Before you can explore Jupyter notebooks, you need to get them up and running! On the command line, type `jupyter lab` and press `Enter`. This will start up a jupyter lab server and open your default browser connected to this server. On the main page you'll see a file explorer interface. Notice that you cannot go any further up the directory structure that where you started the server. For security reasons, you should run out of a sane sub-directory, not from your home directory. Clicking on a part of the path at the top of the page will change the working directory to that location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tabs at the top of the interface `File`, `Running`, and `Clusters` allow you to see the file explorer, state of running notebooks, and parallel execution information. In the `File` tab you can navigate to find notebooks and click to launch them or create new ones. Click on the `New` button to create a new item. New items can be:\n",
    "* **Notebook** - Create a new notebook\n",
    "* **Text File** - Opens a built-in editor to create text based files\n",

    "* You can navigate with the mouse or arrow keys\n",

It runs the current cell and advances to the next cell. `Ctrl-Enter` will run the current cell without advancing. Shortcuts for split, merge, and delete are also very useful. Don't do these operations by hand - let the computer do the work!\n",

There are different flavors of markdown, but the [basics](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) are supported across the board and generally cover 80% of the use cases. HTML is also valid in markdown cells. In fact, all of the text and the header of this notebook are markdown/HTML. With markdown you can create headings, embed images, link to other pages, create lists, and more. We aren't going to exhaustively cover markdown, but the essentials can help you make really nice notebooks. Remember, the better your documentation, the more you'll thank yourself later. Think of the notebook as a lab notebook.\n",
